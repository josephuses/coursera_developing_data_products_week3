## Introduction

The objectives of this project are:

- create a web page presentation using Rmarkdown
- use interactive plots created with `plotly`.

The source code for this presentation can be found at [my github repo]().


## The data

For this exercise, we are going to use the Motor Trend Car Road Tests (`mtcars`) data set. Specifically, we are going to create a scatterplot of miles per gallon (`mpg`) over weight (1000 lbs, `wt`) that shows the model of the car when we hover over the points. The points are also colored according to the number of cylinders (`cyl`). 


## The plot

Hover through the points to see the car model.

```{r, fig.align='center',fig.width=5,fig.height=4}
library(plotly)
library(tibble)
mtcars2 <- mtcars %>% rownames_to_column("car_model")
plot_ly(mtcars2, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, text = ~car_model, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl))
```
